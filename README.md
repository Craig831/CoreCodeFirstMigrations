# CoreCodeFirstMigrations

This is a demo project that I put together to present at a user group meetup.  Using .Net Core RC2 and Entity Framework Core Code First Migrations, I created a functional REST API solution using a local database.  The initial checkin includes one model and the initial migration.  I plan to add related models in future changes and continue to add migrations as I go.
